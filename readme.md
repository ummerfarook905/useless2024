 # Project Overview: Draw a Circle (Not a Perfect Circle)


 #### Technology Stack
 - html
 - css
 - javascript

## Project Description
 This project allows users to draw on a canvas and see how close they can get to creating a perfect circle. While the goal is simple—drawing a circle—the experience is designed to be fun and engaging. Users can interact with the canvas to create their drawings, and the application provides feedback on their performance, including completion percentage and a "perfectness" score.

## Key Features:
- Canvas Drawing: Users can freely draw on a 500x500 pixel canvas.
- Performance Metrics: After drawing, the application calculates:<br>
    Completion Percentage: Based on the total distance drawn compared to the circumference of the target circle<br>
    Perfectness Score: Measures how closely the drawn path matches a perfect circle based on average deviation from the target radius.
- Interactive Popup: Upon completion of a drawing, a popup appears showing the results and a random GIF for added fun.

#### Challenges Faced
Initially, the team planned to integrate a more complex project involving an API. However, due to difficulties obtaining the necessary API key, the focus shifted to this simpler project. This pivot allowed the team to explore calculations and interactive elements without external dependencies.

### Summary
This simple yet enjoyable project demonstrates basic drawing capabilities with real-time feedback, making it both a learning experience and a source of entertainment for users. It showcases how to engage users through interactive web features while implementing fundamental programming concepts in JavaScript.
