## Basic Details

### Team Members

### Project Description
This project allows users to draw on a canvas and see how close they can get to creating a perfect circle. While the goal is simple‚Äîdrawing a circle‚Äîthe experience is designed to be fun and engaging. Users can interact with the canvas to create their drawings, and the application provides feedback on their performance, including completion percentage and a "perfectness" score.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Initially, the team planned to integrate a more complex project involving an API. However, due to difficulties obtaining the necessary API key.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
So the focus shifted to this simpler project. This pivot allowed the team to explore calculations and interactive elements without external dependencies.
